This repository contains the code (well, at least what has survived) for my robotics project, Linbot.  I started Linbot in 2006 as my first project to use a full scale PC class computer in a robot.  The first variant actually had a half-tower PC case embedded into it.  Note that there isn't much in here, because most of the code got folded into other projects, or just hasn't made it up to GitHub yet.  The first variant got destroyed in a move and there is a half finished second variant, which will be making heavy use of the Kinect and possibly a Neato LIDAR for SLAM.  Expect stuff built with the Point Cloud Library here as well.
